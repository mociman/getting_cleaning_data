# Codebook for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Data Set

## Introduction
These data set extracted from Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones# 

Two datasets included are:
